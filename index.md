## This is a introduction in working with virtual environments with perl 

**Disclaimer: I don't known perl and I don't have an idea what I'm doing. This is learning by doing**

###Synopsis:

Perl packages are installed by `cpan`. There is a package called *virtualenv* for perl. [https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/App-Virtualenv/lib/App/Virtualenv/virtualenv.pl]. 

Installing this lets you create a virtual environment. 

What I wanted was a clean install. This can be achieved by running 
```
virtualenv.pl -el name_of_new_empty_environment
```
